# Binary Search

##### Binary search is an algorithm that with few steps, can search ordered elements in a list of program for example or a word in a dictionary.

##### Imagine having to guess a number between 1 and 50, with the binary search algorithm, we would kick 25, so, we would eliminate half of the numbers, we would have the "tip" that 25 is a still a high kick, so the algorithm would kick a number would be between 1 and 24...
we kick 12,
the number is higher, so, it is between 1 and 11...
we kick 5,
and we found the number!
